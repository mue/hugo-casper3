## hugo-casper3
Hugo port of the Casper 3 theme originally by Ghost. Forked and updated for use in the Mue Blog. Demo can be found at https://blog.muetab.com


## Installation
```$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone git@github.com:mue/hugo-casper3.git
```

Either set the theme in your config to `casper3` or build with the `-t casper3` flag.


## Using the theme
This theme is very image heavy so it is recommended to set a `featured_image` parameter in the front matter of any content.

Content types you wish to appear on the homepage should be set in your [mainSections](https://gohugo.io/functions/where/#mainsections).


## Development Roadmap
- [ ] Use SCSS from original theme instead of compiled CSS - also needs Hugo Pipes setting up
- [x] Multi author support and author taxonomy (done via [this commit](https://github.com/mue/hugo-casper3/commit/31b96b5abe874a90b97b64022589db8a4462485a))


## Support
*Text from the [original author](https://github.com/jonathanjanssens) of this repository is preserved below*

It would be nice if you leave the credit to me in the footer, unless you make a donation to show support. I can't really police this though, it's MIT licensed anyway so you can do whatever you want with the theme...

If you would like to show your appreciation to me for working on this theme you can <a href="https://paypal.me/JonathanJanssens">donate with Paypal</a> here.
